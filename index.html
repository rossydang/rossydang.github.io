<p> Hi! I'm Rossy. I'm a 2nd year undergraduate at Georgia Tech majoring in computer science! As a first generation college 
    student in my family, I'm passionate about helping people grow professionally and learn about the resources they have availiable to them
that they can use to find a better job and create a brighter future for themselves. For much of my life, I've worried a lot about the future, thinking about
how I would do things like support my aging parents financially, and my focusing on my career has always been a way for me to be hopeful about the future. I know scary
it can be to start a career mostly yourself, and I want to let people know that they aren't alone in feeling that way.  </p>

 Aside from my studies, I also find that I enjoy learning outside of class. I especially love buying random STEM kits and just playing around with them, like this model engine kit. I didn't get to play with these as a kid, but now I can!
